## Steps and Tabs Compatibility

::: callout error Important Limitation
**Steps and tabs containers are incompatible** - they cannot be nested within each other due to markdown parsing conflicts. Use them as separate sections instead.

**Supported in steps:** Cards, callouts, buttons  
**Not supported:** Tabs containers

- **Responsive design** - Works on all screen sizes
- **Theme integration** - Matches your site's theme
- **Smart list handling** - Only step items get special styling, nested lists remain normal

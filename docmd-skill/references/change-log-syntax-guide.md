# Changelog Container

The `changelog` container allows you to present version history and release notes in a clean, timeline layout. It separates metadata (dates/versions) from the narrative content, making it easy for users to scan updates.

## Usage

The changelog container uses a specific syntax where entries are separated by `==` markers.

::: callout info
Container blocks (like `::: changelog`) should be preceded by a blank line.
:::

**Syntax:**

```markdown
::: changelog

== Version/Date String
Content for this version.
Supports **Markdown**, lists, and other containers.

== Next Version/Date String
Content for the next version.

:::
```

**`==`**: This marker denotes the start of a new entry. Everything after `==` on the same line is treated as the "Date" or "Version" badge on the left side of the timeline.
